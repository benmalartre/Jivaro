# FieldBase

FieldBase is an abstract schema that acts as the
base class for all UsdVol field schemas. If you need to extend UsdVol with your
own custom Field schemas, your Field schemas should directly or indirectly
inherit from FieldBase.

```{admonition} Don't Create FieldBase Prims Directly
:class: note

As FieldBase is an abstract schema, in practice you will most likely use one
of the various derived field schemas when creating new field prims, such as 
OpenVDBAsset or Field3DAsset.
