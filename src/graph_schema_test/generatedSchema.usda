  with which clients of already-built nodes networks will interact.  Please
  see "Interface Inputs" for a detailed
  explanation of what the interface provides, and how to construct and
  use it, to effectively share/instance nodes networks.

  These are typically connected to an input on a other node inside the node-graph.
  These are also used to author and animate input parameters.

  from objects of any of the schema classes listed above.  If it seems
  onerous to need to construct a secondary schema object to interact with
  Inputs and Outputs, keep in mind that any function whose purpose is either
  to walk shot description networks via their connections, or to create such
  networks, can typically be written entirely in terms of 
  ConnectableAPI objects, without needing to care what the underlying
  prim type is.

  Additionally, the most common ConnectableAPI behaviors
  (creating Inputs and Outputs, and making connections) are wrapped as
  convenience methods on the prim schema classes (creation) and 
  InputPort and OutputPort.

    Coordinate systems are implicitly established by UsdGeomXformable
    prims, using their local space.  That coordinate system may be
    bound (i.e., named) from another prim.  The binding is encoded
    as a single-target relationship in the "coordSys:" namespace.
    Coordinate system bindings apply to descendants of the prim
    where the binding is expressed, but names may be re-bound by
    descendant prims.

    Named coordinate systems are useful in animation workflows.
    An example is camera base sculpting.  
    Using the paint coordinate frame avoids the need to assign 
    a UV set to the object, and can be a concise way to project
    sculpt across a collection of objects with a single shared
    paint coordinate system.

    This is a non-applied API schema.
